NICO DESHLER


Nico graduated from the University of California Berkeley in 2021 with degrees in physics and computer science. His interest in computational imaging began while working on a lensless computational camera called DiffuserCam as an undergraduate researcher in the Waller Lab. The joint design of optics and algorithms offers an entirely new paradigm for imaging – one that enables interesting functionalities such as single-shot 3D imaging, single-shot hyperspectral imaging, and video from rolling shutter. He spent the last two years of my undergraduate experience working part-time at Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Technology Center where he supported the development of an interferometric computational camera called SPIDER which sought to collapse bulky space-based telescopes onto printable photonic integrated circuits.

Upon joining the Intelligent Imaging and Design Lab in 2022, Nico has explored imaging modalities predicated on a quantum description of light. His PhD research seeks to create quantum super-resolution imaging systems that leverage ideas from compressive sensing and adaptive Bayesian estimation.
