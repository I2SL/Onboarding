# Onboarding

Welcome! If you are reading this, it probably means you have joined our lab and are excited to dive into research!
The goal of this repository is to teach you a few important tools that will help you organize, maintain, and publish your research in a way that upholds the principles of open science. The repository contains a few examples that are meant to give you hands-on experience with these tools so that you can seamlessly integrate into our lab's research workflows. We look forward to seeing what you discover


# Setup and installation
- install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your local machine
- install [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

## Lesson 1.6: Merge Conflicts

# Lesson 2: Project Development

## Lesson 2.1: Which programming language should I use?
  - If you are joining a project with an already well-developed codebase, your options are somewhat limited as you will have to make changes to the codebase in the existing languages. Otherwise if you are going to be working on a new project with a blank repository, you're in luck! Here you have complete agency (with the consent of your team members) as to  how the program will be designed and which language it will be written in. We suggest that you hoose a language that you can develop quickly in, but also one that is well-known and open source to eliminte the possibility of dependecy issues. For instance if you are choosing between developing in Python or Matlab, choose Python. Why? It is an open-source programming language that i accessible and has essntially all the smae functionality as matlab. Also it , it has easy to   
## Lesson 2.2: Code Documentation standards
  - file organization
  - naming conventions:
    - variables: snake case e.g. `my_var`
    - class names: upper case camel e.g `MyClass`
    - constants: capitalized with underscores e.g. `MY_CONSTANT`
  - commenting code
# Lesson 2.3: Project Documentation Standards
  - making a wiki page for weekly progress reports
  - maintainning a repository webpage
  - 
 
# Lesson 3: High Performance Computing 
## Lesson 3.1: I<sup>2</sup>SL computing cluster
## Lesson 3.2: Accessing and interacting with the cluster
## Lesson 3.3: Submitting jobs to the cluster
