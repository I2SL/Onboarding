# Onboarding

Welcome! 

If you are reading this, it probably means you have joined our lab and are excited to dive into research!
The goal of this repository is to teach you how to setup and use a few important tools that will help you organize, maintain, and publish your research in a way that upholds the principles of open science. The repository contains a few examples that are meant to give you hands-on experience with these tools so that you can seamlessly integrate into our lab's research workflows. 

We look forward to what you discover!


This repository contains 3 introductory Lessons:

# Lesson 0: Setup and installation
- install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your local machine


# Lesson 1: Git
## Lesson 1.1: What is version control?
## Lesson 1.2: Git Terminal
## Lesson 1.3: Cloning your project repository
## Lesson 1.4: Pulling, editting, and pushing
## Lesson 1.5: Branching
## Lesson 1.6: Merge Conflicts

# Lesson 2: Project Development

## Lesson 2.1: How should I develop my codebase?
 If you are joining a project with an already well-developed codebase, your freedom to design your project is somewhat limited. The file structure, programming languages, and dependencies are already established for you. Otherwise if you are going to be working on a new project with a blank repository, you're in luck! Here you have complete agency (with the consent of your team members) as to how the program will be designed and which languages will be used to create it. We suggest that you choose a language that you can develop quickly in, but one that is also open source to eliminate the possibility of versioning issues. For instance if you are choosing between developing in Python or Matlab, choose Python. Why? 
 1) It is an open-source programming language which makes it accessible and easy to update
 2) It has all the same functionality as matlab
 3) You can run your code alongside markdown blocks for better readibility (e.g. JupyterNoteboks)


Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are critical to efficiently writing and debugging code. Here are some free IDE recommendations for different open source programming languages.


| Language  | IDE |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Python  | [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) |
| Java  | [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) | 
| HTML/Javascript/CSS  | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  | 
| C/C++  | [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)  |
| R | [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) |

As a general text editor, we recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/)




for JetBrains has several really nice few really great IDE's for 

If you do choose to use Python for your project, here are a few helpful steps for getting things If so,


- install [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
  - `conda install JupyterNotbebook`
  - `conda install numpy`
  - `conda install matplotlib`
- install PyCharm
 ## Creating Conda environments

## Lesson 2.2: Code Documentation standards
  - file organization
  - naming conventions:
    - variables: snake case e.g. `my_var`
    - class names: upper case camel e.g `MyClass`
    - constants: capitalized with underscores e.g. `MY_CONSTANT`
  - commenting code
  
# Lesson 2.3: Project Documentation Standards
  - making a wiki page for weekly progress reports
  - maintaining a webpage for your project repository
  - including refernces and a page for further learning (curate research papers that have been helpful to your journey)
  - 
 
# Lesson 3: I<sup>2</sup>SL High Performance Computing 
## Lesson 3.1: I<sup>2</sup>SL computing cluster
## Lesson 3.2: Accessing and interacting with the cluster
## Lesson 3.3: Submitting jobs to the cluster
