# Onboarding

Welcome! 

If you are reading this, it probably means you have joined our lab and are excited to dive into research!
The goal of this repository is to teach you how to setup and use a few important tools that will help you organize, maintain, and publish your research in a way that upholds the principles of open science. The repository contains a few examples that are meant to give you hands-on experience with these tools so that you can seamlessly integrate into our lab's research workflows. 

We look forward to what you discover!
