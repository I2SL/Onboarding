# Onboarding

Welcome! 

If you are reading this, it probably means you have joined our lab and are excited to dive into research!
The goal of this repository is to set you up with a few important tools that will help you organize, maintain, and publish your research in a way that upholds the principles of [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science). The repository contains walkthroughs that are meant to give you hands-on experience with these tools so that you can seamlessly integrate them into your workflow. 

We look forward to what you discover!


# Setup and Installations

To work with github and follow the onboarding lessons you'll first have to install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your local machine. 
- *Windows* : Make sure to select the Windows Explore Integration boxes in the installation menu. This will save you some time navigating through directories in a terminal.
- *MacOS* : You will have to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) first before you install git.
- *Linux* : You have it easy.

It is also valuable to have a good text editor like [atom](https://atom.io/).
